1. -> Timer can help this checking out write code with creating account as Python
      First Attempt: check timer 10 minutes if fail +10 min -> 20min repeat while program make it
      Second Attempt: Purpose if there are times limit. For example, if 10 times repeat, block the MAC Address or IP Address
                      -> My opinion is MAC Address blocking. The reason of why is, while using VPN Proxy it also counted and blocked it
                      -> Tor browser is also blocked by meta. I think if header or connection of Web Browser is Tor browser, Meta blocks aboutr it
